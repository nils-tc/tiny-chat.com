# How to create your own Slack app

You need to have permissions to access your workspace settings and create a Slack app, **you will need the "Workspace Owner," "Admin" or "App Manager" permission**.

Then, you are able to access https://api.slack.com/apps/new to start creating your new slack app.

On your custom flow directory there is a `app-manifest.json` file, you can use it to set up the permissions of your Slack App, otherwise you can select one by one the permissions.

And it's done..! Creating your own Slack app is pretty smooth if you do not distribute it to others workspaces.
