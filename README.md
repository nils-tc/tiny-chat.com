# Welcome to the Tiny Chat docs / guides / custom flows repository!

This repository contains documentation, coding examples for custom flows, and guides on how to utilize [Tiny Chat](https://tiny-chat.com). Whether you're looking to extend Tiny Chat's functionalities or learn how to integrate it with your applications, you'll find resources and examples here to guide you through the process.

## Getting Started

Be sure to have a [Tiny Chat](https://tiny-chat.com) account.
If your custom flow needs your own slack bot, you will need access to your Slack workspace settings (you need to have the "Workspace Owner," "Admin" or "App Manager" permission).
